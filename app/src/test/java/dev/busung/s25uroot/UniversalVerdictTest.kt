/**
 * What a universal run is, when the phone cannot be asked.
 *
 * This flow is the one with no shell of its own, and on this device that means no reading at all: the kernel's
 * module list is denied to app domains, `/system/bin/su` is not visible to an app even with root live, and the
 * chain's own markers never arrive because the daemon it starts becomes the KernelSU service instead of
 * returning. Waiting therefore cannot help - it reported rooted phones as failures once per run - so the chain's
 * own steps are the verdict, and this file is where that rule is decided rather than on a phone.
 *
 * The exception is the case with a shell: then the app *can* look, and silence means the run really did fail.
