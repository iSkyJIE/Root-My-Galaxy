 * The gate's rule for Shizuku, which is the one place a boot can be held back by a setting.
 *
 * The cases worth writing down are the ones that cannot be tried by hand: a phone whose Shizuku is
 * switched off in settings but present on the device, one that asked for Shizuku with nothing able to
 * start it - the case the wait would spend two minutes discovering - and the one where the payload does
 * not need the transport being waited for at all.
